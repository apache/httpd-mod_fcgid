version 0.76 ( Jul 6th 2004 )
1. Code fix. Replace the depreciated BRIGADE_FOREACH macro, which compile against httpd 2.1-Dev.
	(Patch by Paul Querna(chip at force-elite.com))
2. PHP FastCGI Wrapper now can be run both with "share" and "non-share" mode.
	For example: there are three PHP script: foo.php, bar.php, database.php. foo.php and bar.php
are simple scripts that do not connect to database, but database.php do.
	In "share" mode, there is only one type of PHP fastcgi process, all .php script will be run with any free fastcgi process, 
so, once database.php is called, the php fastcgi process will be "polluted", and a database connection will
be keep by this fastcgi php process.
	If all .php is running with "non-share" mode, all .php script will be run separately, that mean there
will have three types of fastcgi php process, one for foo.php, one for bar.php, and one for database.php. i
This will spawn unnecessary php process because foo.php and bar.php should share the php process.

	Now you can override this dilemma with the following configuration:
<Directory "G:/Apache2/htdocs/php">
    SetHandler fcgid-script
    Options execCGI
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    FCGIWrapper "c:/php/php.exe"
    FCGIWrapper "c:/php/php.exe" database.php
</Directory>
	
	"share" mode is default, but you can overwrite it with the second FCGIWrapper configuration line.
