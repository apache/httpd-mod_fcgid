version 0.80 ( Jul 27th 2004 )
1. Duplex channel added, Apache now will get notification once FastCGI process is spawned.
2. Bug fix. The FastCGI process share the signal handler with PM(Process Manager) process, if 
	the FastCGI process get signal after fork() and before execve(), it will corrupt the
	share memory. ( It's a very short interval between fork() and execve(), so this rarely happens )
