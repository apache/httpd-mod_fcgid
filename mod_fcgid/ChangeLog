verison 1.03 ( Nov 3rd 2004 )
1. Add configuration "OutputBufferSize". The old implementation keep CGI output in a 64k bytes buffer,
	before send them to web browser(for better network IO performance). 
	If FCGI_Fflush() is called in your application, please add "OutputBufferSize 0" in you 
	httpd.conf, which will not keep any CGI output in cache buffer.
	The default value of OutputBufferSize is 64k byte.
	(Thank Grzegorz Sampolski, gs at blink.pl)

version 1.02 ( Oct 1st 2004 )
1. Bug fix. (Win32 only) Forward request to incorrect process when a script is a directory in the URL.
	For example, if in the "cgi-bin" directory there are two programs, "a.exe" and "b.exe".  
	If you go to the URL "http://localhost/cgi-bin/a.exe/defghi" then a.exe will start.
	Then if you go to the URL "http://localhost/cgi-bin/b.exe/uvwxyz"  the request will be
	processed by the already running a.exe. (Thank rripley at amadvertising.com)

version 1.01 ( Sep 21st 2004 )
1. More graceful implementation of suEXEC on UNIX. (Thank radek at karnet.pl for the advice)

version 1.00 ( Sep 10th 2004 )
1. Release FastCGI process slot before sending buffer back to browser. (less process count)

version 0.88 ( Sep 3rd 2004 )
1. Bug fix. File descriptor is closed twice if connect to UNIX domain socket error.
2. Bug fix. Get server last active time incorrectly.

version 0.87 ( Aug 26th 2004 )
1. suEXEC supported.

version 0.86 ( Aug 22th 2004 )
Some major changes for performance. (Hits/Second is 30% greater than the old implementation)
1. Socket bucket instead of heap bucket. (less memory)
2. Pass buffer to browser, once the size of buffer exceed 64k bytes. (less memory)
3. Non-block unix domain socket on UNIX. (better I/O performance)
4. writev() instead of write() on UNIX. (better I/O performance)
5. Try to read at least 8k bytes each single reading. (better I/O perormance)
6. Disconnect FastCGI server, once browser disconnect. (less process count)

version 0.80 ( Jul 27th 2004 )
1. Duplex channel added, Apache now will get notification once FastCGI process is spawned.
2. Bug fix. The FastCGI process share the signal handler with PM(Process Manager) process, if 
	the FastCGI process get signal after fork() and before execve(), it will corrupt the
	share memory. ( It's a very short interval between fork() and execve(), so this rarely happens )

version 0.77 ( Jul 9th 2004 )
1. Organize the configuration again
	1) add "FCGIWrapperGroup" setting
	2) "FCGIWrapper" now takes only one argument
	3) remove "ServerConfig" setting, because it't not work with wrapper yet
Please visit http://fastcgi.coremail.cn/doc.htm for more information about configuration

version 0.76 ( Jul 6th 2004 )
1. Code fix. Replace the depreciated BRIGADE_FOREACH macro, which compile against httpd 2.1-Dev.
	(Patch by Paul Querna(chip at force-elite.com))
2. PHP FastCGI Wrapper now can be run both with "share" and "non-share" mode.

version 0.74 ( Jun 23rd 2004 )
1. Bug fix. Ignore script checking while running in Win32 PHP wrapper mode.
2. Indent the code with K&R style.

version 0.72 ( Jun 13rd 2004 )
1. Bug fix. Trim the padding nuls at the end of data. (Thank rick.stewart at theinternetco.net)

version 0.7 ( May 22nd 2004 )
1. PHP FastCGI Wrapper is supported on UNIX and Windows.

version 0.62 ( May 18th 2004 )
1. Unix version now compilable with gcc2.95.2
2. Unix version is tested on Solaris7 & Solaris8

version 0.6 ( May 8th 2004 )
1. Unix version is tested on Redhat8(gcc3)
2. Windows version is tested on Win2k(VC6)
