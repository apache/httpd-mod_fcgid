Changes with mod_fcgid 2.3

  *) Fix formatting of several messages, including the oft-seen "mod_fcgid: 
     Can't create shared memory for size %zu byte".  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix declared names of FastCgiAuthenticator and FastCgiAuthenticator-
     Authoritative directives, allowing them to be used.  [Ulf Haueisen
     <ulf dvlp.de>]

  *) Fix vhost-specific DefaultInitEnv settings.  Previously, when setting 
     multiple virtual hosts with the same SuexecUserGroup user and group, the
     process manager use the same process pool for both virtual hosts. This 
     means if one virtual host has a DefaultInitEnv and the other has 
     different values set, a fastcgi request from any of these virtual host
     can go to the same processes, which is inconsistent (a request from 
     virtualhost a with DefaultInitEnv VAL "a", can go to a process spawned 
     with virtualhost b with DefaultInitEnv VAL "b" set).  [Gabriel Barazer
     <gabriel oxeva.fr>]
