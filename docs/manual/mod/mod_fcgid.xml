  <summary>
    <p>Any program assigned to the handler <code>fcgid-script</code> is processed
    using the FastCGI protocol; <module>mod_fcgid</module> starts a sufficient
    number instances of the program to handle concurrent requests, and these
    programs remain running to handle further incoming requests.  This is
    significantly faster than using the default <module>mod_cgi</module> or
    <module>mod_cgid</module> modules to launch the program upon each request.
    However, the programs invoked by <module>mod_fcgid</module> continue to
    consume resources, so the administrator must weigh the impact of invoking
    a particular program once per request against the resources required to
    leave a sufficient number of instances running continuously.</p>

    <p>The pool of fcgid-invoked programs is shared between all httpd workers.
    Configuration directives below let the administrator tune the number of
    instances of the program that will run concurrently.</p>

    <p>Specific executables are assigned this handler either by having a name 
    containing an extension defined by the 
    <directive module="mod_mime">AddHandler</directive> directive, or with an
    override using the <directive module="mod_mime">SetHandler</directive> 
    directive (e.g., for all files in a specific directory such as cgi-bin).</p>

    <p>For an introduction to using CGI scripts with Apache, see
    the generic tutorial on <a href="../howto/cgi.html">Dynamic Content
    With CGI</a>.</p>

  <section id="examples">
    <title>Examples</title>

    <note type="hint"><title>Note</title>
    <p>The examples assume that mod_fcgid and other necessary
    modules are loaded into the server already, either built-in or 
    via the <directive module="mod_so">LoadModule</directive>
    directive.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the example configurations provide full access
    to the applications using access control directives which work 
    with Apache 2.0 and 2.2.  These directives are not appropriate
    for all environments, and they do not work for development
    levels of Apache HTTP Server (Subversion trunk).</p>
    </note>

    <p>The first example is a very simple Perl FastCGI application,
    and its configuration directives.  This is typical for FastCGI
    applications which are named in the URL and which require no
    special configuration.</p>

    <example><title>Perl FastCGI application - /usr/local/apache/fcgi-bin/foo.pl</title>
    #!/usr/bin/perl<br />
    use CGI::Fast;<br />
    <br />
    while (my $q = CGI::Fast->new) {<br />
    <indent>
        print("Content-Type: text/plain\n\n");<br />
        foreach $var (sort(keys(%ENV))) {<br />
        <indent>
            $val = $ENV{$var};<br />
            $val =~ s|\n|\\n|g;<br />
            $val =~ s|"|\\"|g;<br />
            print "${var}=\"${val}\"\n";<br />
        </indent>
        }<br />
    </indent>
    }<br />
    </example>

    <example><title>Configuration directives</title>
    &lt;Directory /usr/local/apache/fcgi-bin/&gt;<br />
    <indent>
      SetHandler fcgid-script<br />
      Options +ExecCGI<br />
      <br />
      # Customize the next two directives for your requirements.<br />
      Order allow,deny<br />
      Allow from all<br />
    </indent>
    &lt;/Directory&gt;<br />
    </example>

    <p>PHP applications are usually configured using the
    <directive module="mod_fcgid">FCGIDWrapper</directive> directive
    and a corresponding wrapper script, as in the following
    example:</p>

    <example><title>PHP application - /usr/local/phpapp/phpinfo.php</title>
    &lt;?php<br />
    <indent>
      phpinfo();<br />
    </indent>
    ?&gt;<br />
    </example>

    <example><title>Configuration directives</title>
    Alias /phpapp/ /usr/local/phpapp/<br />
    &lt;Location /phpapp/&gt;<br />
    <indent>
      AddHandler fcgid-script .php<br />
      Options +ExecCGI<br />
      FCGIDWrapper /usr/local/bin/php-wrapper .php<br />
      # Uncomment the following line if cgi.fix_pathinfo<br />
      # is set to 1 in php.ini:<br />
      # FCGIDPHPFixPathinfoEnable 1<br />
      <br />
      # Customize the next two directives for your requirements.<br />
      Order allow,deny<br />
      Allow from all<br />
    </indent>
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    <br />
    &lt;FilesMatch /usr/local/phpapp/phpinfo.php&gt;
    <indent>
      # Customize the next two directives for your requirements.<br />
      Order allow,deny<br />
      Allow from all<br />
    </indent>
    &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;

    </example>

    <example><title>PHP wrapper script - /usr/local/bin/php-wrapper</title>
    #!/bin/sh<br />
    # Set desired PHP_FCGI_* environment variables.<br />
    # Example:<br />
    PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS=1000<br />
    export PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS<br />
    <br />
    # Replace with the path to your FastCGI-enabled PHP executable<br />
    exec /usr/local/bin/php-cgi<br />
    </example>

    <default>FCGIDBusyTimeout 300</default>
    <contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>
    <usage>
      <p>This is the maximum time limit for request handling.  If a FastCGI
      request does not complete within FCGIDBusyTimeout seconds, it will be
      subject to termination.  Because the check is performed at the
      interval defined by <directive module="mod_fcgid">FCGIDBusyScanInterval</directive>,
      request handling may be allowed to proceed for a longer period of time.</p>

      <p>The purpose of this directive is to terminate hung applications.
      The default timeout may need to be increased for applications that
      can take longer to process the request.</p>

      <p>Use <directive>FCGIDDefaultInitEnv</directive> to define environment

      <note type="hint"><title>Note</title>
      <p>These settings are associated with the FastCGI process and are 
      not reset on every request based on the current virtual host
      settings.  The FastCGI process will run with the environment
      settings of the virtual host of the request that caused the FastCGI
      process to be started; these are not necessarily the same as those
      of the virtual hosts of subsequent requests.</p>

      <p>This directive sets the minimum number of processes in a class that

    <usage>
      <p>The module maintains a process activity score for each FastCGI
      application which represents process activity; it uses that score to 
      determine if more instances of the FastCGI application can be spawned
      (started).  If the current score is higher than the value of this 
      directive, a new instance of the FastCGI application cannot yet be 
      started.</p>

      <p>The <directive module="mod_fcgid">FCGIDSpawnScore</directive> directive 
      determines how much is added to the score for every spawned application
      process.  The <directive module="mod_fcgid">FCGIDTerminationScore</directive>
      directive determines how much is added to the score for every terminated
      application process.  The <directive module="mod_fcgid">FCGIDTimeScore</directive>
      directive determines how much is subtracted from the score every second.</p>
