Changes with mod_fcgid 2.3.2



Changes with mod_fcgid 2.3.1

  *) Suppress "need AuthType to note auth failure" error-level messages when a
     FastCGIAccessChecker fails without any other kind of authentication 
     (Basic, Digest) configured. [Eric Covener]
  
  *) Complete the unix port to 2.3-dev trunk.  [William Rowe]

  *) Provide a default, mandatory environment as with mod_cgi (with the
     inclusion of LD_LIBRARY_PATH or similar variables on other platforms),
     unless overridden by DefaultInitEnv.  [William Rowe]

  *) Handle DefaultInitEnv for case-insensitive platforms by forcing the env
     variable names to uppercase on Win32, OS2 and Netware.  [William Rowe]

  *) Don't try to set the ownership of the socket directory unless running
     as root and the directory was just created.  This allows the default
     httpd.conf (with some daemon User/Group) to be used by non-root.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix formatting of several messages, including the oft-seen "mod_fcgid: 
     Can't create shared memory for size %zu byte".  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix declared names of FastCgiAuthenticator and FastCgiAuthenticator-
     Authoritative directives, allowing them to be used.  [Ulf Haueisen
     <ulf dvlp.de>]

  *) Fix vhost-specific DefaultInitEnv settings.  Previously, when setting 
     multiple virtual hosts with the same SuexecUserGroup user and group, the
     process manager use the same process pool for both virtual hosts. This 
     means if one virtual host has a DefaultInitEnv and the other has 
     different values set, a fastcgi request from any of these virtual host
     can go to the same processes, which is inconsistent (a request from 
     virtualhost a with DefaultInitEnv VAL "a", can go to a process spawned 
     with virtualhost b with DefaultInitEnv VAL "b" set).  [Gabriel Barazer
     <gabriel oxeva.fr>]
