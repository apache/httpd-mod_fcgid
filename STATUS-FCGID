CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:



CURRENT VOTES:



REALLY NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

  * For in-tree builds, extending config_vars.mk with our local
    [exp_]vars and installing that tree.

  * Create a manual module page.

  * Create and install an conf/extra/httpd-fcgid.conf.

  * Win32 stderr is broken.  It's not possible to capture errors immediately
    upon invocation; this is apparently a design failure in std handle passing.
